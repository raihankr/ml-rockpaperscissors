# Rock Paper Scissor Image Classificaiton
A small ML model to classify and predict rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures images.

This project was originally created for my final project in
[Dicoding-Belajar Machine Learning Untuk Pemula](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/184-belajar-machine-learning-untuk-pemula)

# How to Use
* **Open in Google Colab**

  If you want to test this model, it's recommended to open this project at
  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G5wGPMbbqt_1LWuV_he14lYGPnQEx2LY?usp=sharing)
  because it's uses Google Colab API to upload user's images and make a prediction.
  
  Keep in mind that the subject images should have green background because this model was trained with only samples with green background.
